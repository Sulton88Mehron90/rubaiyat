    "O Life, you put many traps in my way\nDare to try, is what you clearly say\nAll that is, thy command must obey\nYou lead me away and call me astray.",
    
    "With love and joy yourself surround\nUpon this earth roam free, unbound\nAnd when you’re six feet under the ground\nYour legacy of joy and love abound.",
    
    "Once transpired, asleep or awake\nEven with sorrow, pain and heart ache\nNothing will change, nothing will shake\nYou can only look for another break\nAnd your chance take, a new life make.",
    
    "We are the puppets and fate the puppeteer\nThis is not a metaphor, but a truth sincere\nOn this stage, fate for sometime our moves steer\nInto the chest of non-existence, one by one disappear.",
    
    "The hands of fate play our game\nWe the players are given a name\nSome are tame, others gain fame\nYet in the end, we’re all the same.\nGood and evil, our moral prison,\nJoy and sorrow passing like season,\nFate in the way of logic and reason\nIs the victim of far worse treason.",
    
    "Joy and sorrow in duality\nGood and evil in morality\nAre frailties of humanity;\nYet more pronounced is reality.\nSome in deep thought spirit seek\nSome lost in awe, of doubt reek\nI fear the voice, hidden but not weak\nCry out \"awake! Both ways are oblique.\"",
    
    "Some are thoughtful on their way\nSome are doubtful, so they pray.\nI hear the hidden voice that may\nShout, \"Both paths lead astray.\"",
    
    "Some always seek the rational mind\nSome will appeal to faith that’s blind\nIf you turn within, you’ll surely find\nBoth paths will lead further behind.",
    
    "Some are in endless pursuit\nSome seek the forbidden fruit\nI fear the voice that is mute\nCry out, \"path ain’t fruit nor root!\"",
    
    "Alike for those who for TO-DAY prepare,\nAnd those that after a TO-MORROW stare,\nA Muezzin from the Tower of Darkness cries\n\"Fools! your Reward is neither Here nor There.\"",
    
    "In life devote yourself to joy and love\nBehold the beauty of the peaceful dove\nThose who live, in the end must all perish\nLive as if you are already in heavens above\nIn life devote yourself to joy and love\nBehold the beauty of the peaceful dove\nAnd Live your Life\nAs if you are already in heavens above",
    
    "I only follow the path of my heart\nIn desolate desert I make my start\nI follow my heart, I do my part\nThe path of my heart is what you chart.",
    
    "We strive in life so in the end\nParadise attain, to heavens ascend.\nIt is better our ways amend\nThis moment now, joyously spend.",
    
    "Beloved friends let us gather\nFor each other, together care\nWith raised cups salute and share\nIn memory of he who isn’t there.",
    
    "Every creature honor and respect\nBird or beast, plant or insect\nIf you look at life you will detect\nFrom dust to dust, divine intellect.",
    
    "The grass that grows by every stream\nLike angelic smiles faintly gleam\nStep gently, cause it not to scream\nFor it has grown from a lover’s dream.",
    
    "The caravan of life shall always pass\nBeware that is fresh as sweet young grass\nLet’s not worry about what tomorrow will amass\nFill my cup again, this night will pass, alas.",
    
    "The secrets eternal neither you know nor I\nAnd answers to the riddle neither you know nor I\nBehind the veil there is much talk about us, why\nWhen the veil falls, neither you remain nor I",
    
    "Before time takes you by surprise\nAsk for good red wine and get wise\nYou are not of gold, don’t believe the lies\nYou are put to dust, once again you’ll rise",
    
    "Do not focus upon the size\nNor for the worldly compromise\nQuality is your only prize\nTranscend your earthly disguise\nWithout fear, without despise\nWith love and joy improvise",
    
    "Don’t permit sorrow to be your friend\nSadness and pain become your trend\nDon’t let the book or the farm you tend\nRule your life before to earth you descend"
